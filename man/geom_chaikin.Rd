}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{iterations}{Integer. Number of iterations to apply. Must be between 0 and 10.}

\item{ratio}{Numeric. Cutting ratio must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{closed}{Logical. Specify if result is an open or closed shape.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{geom, stat}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_chaikin} and \code{stat_chaikin}.}

\description{
Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm can be used to smooth sharp
corners of a path.
}
\details{
Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm iteratively turns a jagged path into
a smooth path.

The recursion formula starts from two vertices A and B, which represent
a single corner of your path. From this, the algorithm derives two new
points: one at the specified ratio when going from point A to point B,
and one when going from B to A in the opposite direction.
By default, a ratio of 0.25 results in two points: the first at 25\% of
point A and the other at 75\% of point A (or 25\% of point B). Those new
points form a smoother path. Then the algorithm applies the same rule to
each pair of new points. The rule is applied iterations times. The
maximum number of iterations is 10, default is 5.

The ratio parameter  must be a number between 0 and 1. If ratio > 0.5,
then it will be flipped to 1 - ratio, and a message is shown.

\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_chaikin() understands the following aesthetics (required
aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item alpha
\item color
\item group
\item linetype
\item size
}
}

\examples{
set.seed(42)
dat <- data.frame(
  x = seq.int(10),
  y = sample(15:30, 10)
)

p1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(linetype = "12")

p1 +
  geom_chaikin()

p1 +
  geom_chaikin(iterations = 1)

triangle <- data.frame(x = c(0, 0, 1), y = c(0, 1, 1))
p2 <- ggplot(triangle, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_path(linetype = "12") +
  coord_equal()

# ratio let's you control
p2 + geom_chaikin(ratio = .1)
p2 + geom_chaikin(ratio = .5)

# closed parameter to generate a closed shape - or not
p2 + geom_chaikin(iterations = 5, ratio = 0.25, closed = FALSE) # default
p2 + geom_chaikin(closed = TRUE)
