\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[ggplot2:aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{location}{A character vector specifying which observations to highlight, defaults to \code{"last"}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{orientation}{The orientation of the layer. The default (\code{NA}) automatically determines
the orientation from the aesthetic mapping. In the rare event that this fails it can be given
explicitly by setting \code{orientation} to either \code{"x"} or \code{"y"}. See the Orientation section for more detail.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{geom, stat}{Overwrite the default connection between \code{geom_pointless()} and \code{stat_pointless()}.}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper around \code{geom_point()} with the one additional argument: \code{location}.
It allows to emphazise some observations, namely the first the last, and the minima and maxima, see examples.
This geom is not particularly useful on its own, hence the name, but hopefully in conjunction
with \code{geom_path()} and friends.
}
\section{Details}{

The argument \code{location} allows you to control which observations to highlight - with a point.
When \code{location} is \code{"last"}, the default, a single point will be plotted at the last observations.
Setting \code{location} to \code{"first"} adds a point at the first position.
}

\section{Orientation}{

This geom treats each axis differently and, can thus have two orientations.
Often the orientation is easy to deduce from a combination of the given mappings
and the types of positional scales in use. Thus, ggplot2 will by default try
to guess which orientation the layer should have. Under rare circumstances,
the orientation is ambiguous and guessing may fail. In that case the orientation
can be specified directly using the orientation parameter, which can be either
"x" or "y". The value gives the axis that the geom should run along, "x"
being the default orientation you would expect for the geom.
}

\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_pointless() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item alpha
\item color
\item fill
\item group
\item shape
\item size
\item stroke
}
}

\section{Computed variables}{

\describe{
\item{location}{locations, returned as factor}
}
}

\examples{
x <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 100)
y <- outer(x, 1:5, FUN = \(x, y) sin(x*y)) |> rowSums()

df1 <- data.frame(
  var1 = x,
  var2 = y
)

# not terribly useful on its own ...
p <- ggplot(df1, aes(x = var1, y = var2))
p + geom_pointless()
p + geom_pointless(location = "all")

# ... but in conjunction with geom_line(), hopefully
p <- p + geom_line()
p + geom_pointless()
p + geom_pointless(location = c("first", "last"))
p + geom_pointless(location = c("minimum", "maximum"))
p + geom_pointless(location = c("all"))

# The layer computes one additional variable, `location`, you can map e.g. to the color aesthetic
p + geom_pointless(
 aes(color = after_stat(location)),
 location = c("all"),
 size = 3
 )

\dontrun{
# Example using facets, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/29375169
p <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(x = date, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
 facet_wrap( ~ variable, ncol = 1, scales = 'free_y')

p +
  geom_pointless(
    aes(color = after_stat(location)),
    location = c("minimum", "maximum"),
    size = 2
  )
 }
