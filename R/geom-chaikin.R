#' @details
#' Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm iteratively turns a jagged path into
#' a smooth path.
#'
#' The recursion formula starts from two vertices A and B, which represent
#' a single corner of your path. From this, the algorithm derives two new
#' points: one at the specified ratio when going from point A to point B,
#' and one when going from B to A in the opposite direction.
#' By default, a ratio of 0.25 results in two points: the first at 25% of
#' point A and the other at 75% of point A (or 25% of point B). Those new
#' points form a smoother path. Then the algorithm applies the same rule to
#' each pair of new points. The rule is applied iterations times. The
#' maximum number of iterations is 10, default is 5.
#'
#' The ratio parameter  must be a number between 0 and 1. If ratio > 0.5,
#' then it will be flipped to 1 - ratio, and a message is shown.
