`ggpointless` is an extension of the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library providing additional layers. 

## Installation

You can install `ggpointless` from CRAN with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggpointless")
```

To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) use:

``` {r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("flrd/ggpointless")
```

Once you have installed the package, attach it by calling:

```{r}
library(ggpointless)
```

## What will you get

- `geom_pointless()` -- emphasizes some observations with points
- `geom_lexis()` --	draws a Lexis diagram
- `geom_chaikin()` -- applies chaikin's corner cutting algorithm
- `geom_catenary()` -- draws a catenary curve

See [`vignette("ggpointless")`](https://flrd.github.io/ggpointless/articles/ggpointless.html)
for details and examples.

### geom_pointless
`geom_pointless()` let's you highlight the first, or last observations, sample minimum and sample maximum to provide additional context. Or just some visual sugar. `geom_pointless()` behaves similar to `geom_point()` except that it has a `location` argument. You can set it to `"first"`, `"last"` (default), `"minimum"`, `"maximum"`, and `"all"`, where `"all"` is just shorthand to select `"first"`, `"last"`, `"minimum"` and `"maximum"`.

```{r hello-world}
cols <- c("#f4ae1b", "#d77e7b", "#a84dbd", "#311dfc")
theme_set(theme_minimal())

x <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 500)
y <- outer(x, 1:5, function(x, y) sin(x * y))

df1 <- data.frame(
  var1 = x,
  var2 = rowSums(y)
)

ggplot(df1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_pointless(aes(color = after_stat(location)),
    location = "all",
    size = 3
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols)
```

### geom_lexis
`geom_lexis()` is a combination of a segment and a point layer. Given a start value and an end value, this function draws a 45° line which indicates the duration of an event. Required are `x` and `xend` aesthetics, `y` and `yend` coordinates will be calculated.

```{r geom-lexis, warning=FALSE}
df2 <- data.frame(
  key = c("A", "B", "B", "C", "D"),
  x = c(0, 1, 6, 5, 6),
  xend = c(5, 4, 10, 8, 10)
)

ggplot(df2, aes(x = x, xend = xend, color = key)) +
  geom_lexis(aes(linetype = after_stat(type)), size = 2) +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(df2$x, df2$xend)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +
  scale_linetype_identity() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

### geom_chaikin

Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm let's you turn a ragged path or polygon into a smoothed one. Credit to [Farbfetzen / corner_cutting](https://github.com/Farbfetzen/corner_cutting). 

```{r geom-chaikin, warning=FALSE}
lst <- list(
  data = list(
    closed_square = data.frame(x = c(0, 0, 1, 1), y = c(2, 3, 3, 2)),
    whale = data.frame(x = c(.5, 4, 4, 3.5, 2), y = c(.5, 1, 1.5, .5, 3)),
    open_triangle = data.frame(x = c(3, 3, 5), y = c(2, 3, 3)),
    closed_triangle = data.frame(x = c(3.5, 5, 5), y = c(0, 0, 1.5))
  ),
  color = cols,
  closed = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +
  lapply(lst$data, function(i) {
    geom_polygon(data = i, fill = NA, linetype = "12", color = "#777777")
  }) +
  Map(f = function(data, color, closed) {
    geom_chaikin(data = data, color = color, closed = closed)
  }, data = lst$data, color = lst$color, closed = lst$closed) +
  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = 1.5, y = 1.5)) +
  coord_equal()
```

### geom_catenary

Draws a flexible curve that simulates a chain or rope hanging loosely between
two fixed points. By default, a chain length twice the Euclidean distance
between each x/y combination is used. See [`vignette("ggpointless")`](https://flrd.github.io/ggpointless/articles/ggpointless.html)
for details.

```{r geom-catenary, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(x = 1:5, y = sample(5)),
       aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_catenary() +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#f4ae1b")
```

This curve is called a catenary, from Latin word catēna, which means "chain".

## Data

In addition to the geoms & stats, the following data sets are contained in `ggpointless`:

1. `co2_ml` : [CO~2~ records taken at Mauna Loa](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)
2. `covid_vac` : [COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status)
3. `female_leaders` : [Elected and appointed female heads of state and government](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state_and_government&oldid=1078024588)
