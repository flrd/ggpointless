`ggpointless` is an extension of the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library providing
additional layers. The following functions are implemented in this small package: 

- `geom_pointless()` / `stat_pointless()`: functions that are making it easy to add minimal emphasis to your plots by 
means of a point layer. 

- `geom_lexis()` / `stat_lexis()`: a layer to plot a 45° 'lifeline' of an event

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("ggpointless")
# Or install the development version
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("flrd/ggpointless")
```

## Using ggpointless

Once you have installed the package, simply attach it by calling:

```{r}
library(ggpointless)
```

The main functions in this package are `geom_pointless()` and `geom_lexis()`. They work like you are used to from other `geom_*` functions.

### geom_pointless
Using the functions `geom_pointless()`, which is a constructor for `stat_pointless()`, you can highlight the first, or last observations, sample minimum and maximum with the goal to provide some additional context. Or just some visual sugar. `geom_pointless()` behaves like `geom_point()` does with the addition of a `location` argument. You can set it to `"first"`, `"last"` (default), `"minimum"`, `"maximum"`, and `"all"`, where `"all"` is just shorthand to select `"first"`, `"last"`, `"minimum"` and `"maximum"`.

```{r hello-world}
cols <- c('#f4ae1b', '#d77e7b', '#a84dbd', '#311dfc')
theme_set(theme_minimal())

x <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 500)
y <- outer(x, 1:5, function(x, y) sin(x*y))

df1 <- data.frame(
  var1 = x,
  var2 = rowSums(y)
)

ggplot(df1, aes(x = var1, y = var2)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_pointless(aes(color = after_stat(location)),
                 location = "all",
                 size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols)
```

### geom_lexis
`geom_lexis()` is a combination of a segment and a point layer. Given a start value and an end value, this geom draws a 45° line which indicates the duration of an event. Required are `x` and `xend` aesthetics, `y` and `yend` coordinates will be  calculated for you.

```{r geom-lexis, warning=FALSE}
df2 <- data.frame(
  key = c("A", "B", "B", "C", "D"),
  x = c(0, 1, 6, 5, 6),
  xend = c(5, 4, 10, 8, 10)
)

ggplot(df2, aes(x = x, xend = xend, color = key)) +
  geom_lexis(aes(linetype = after_stat(type)), size = .5, point_size = 3) +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(df2$x, df2$xend)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = cols) +
  scale_linetype_identity() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

```{r geom-chaikin, warning=FALSE}
lst <- list(
  data = list(
    closed_square = data.frame(x = c(4, 4, 5, 5), y = c(2, 3, 3, 2)),
    open_triangle = data.frame(x = c(0, 0, 1), y = c(1, 2, 2)),
    closed_triangle = data.frame(x = c(3.5, 5, 5), y = c(0, 0, 1.5)),
    wiggle = data.frame(x = c(1, 4, 4, 3, 2), y = c(1, 1, 1.5, .5, 3))
  ),
  color = cols,
  closed = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +
  lapply(lst$data, function(i) {
    geom_polygon(data = i, fill = NA, linetype = "12", color = '#777777')
  }) +
  Map(f = function(data, color, closed) {
    geom_chaikin(data = data, color = color, closed = closed)
  }, data = lst$data, color = lst$color, closed = lst$closed) +
  coord_equal()
```

## Data

The `ggpointless` package contains the following data sets:

1. `co2_ml` : [CO~2~ records taken at Mauna Loa](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)
2. `covid_vac` : [COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status)
3. `female_leaders` : [Elected and appointed female heads of state and government](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state_and_government&oldid=1078024588)

See the [`vignette("examples")`](https://flrd.github.io/ggpointless/articles/examples.html) for possible use cases.
